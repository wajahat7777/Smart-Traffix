# Smart-Traffix
Smart Traffic Management System (STMS) 

Project :
The SmartTraffix is Smart Traffic Management System (STMS) aims to simulate and
manage traffic flow at a four-way intersection, considering multiple factors such as regular
vehicles, emergency vehicles, and heavy vehicles. This system will optimize traffic light
timings, manage queues, and prioritize emergency vehicles, ensuring smooth traffic flow while
adhering to predefined rules. The system will handle dynamic traffic conditions, including
peak and off-peak hours, while ensuring safety and efficiency.
Key features of the system include the ability to manage regular vehicles, heavy vehicles, and
emergency vehicles. Heavy vehicles, which are only allowed during specific time windows to
avoid disrupting regular traffic flow. Additionally, emergency vehicles will always be
prioritized over other vehicle types to ensure quick passage through the intersection. There will
be challan management for vehicles exceeding the speed limit. Car owners are able to receive
and pay challan.

--I have used threading for all the fucntions and have used deadlocks implementations to avoid dead locks.
